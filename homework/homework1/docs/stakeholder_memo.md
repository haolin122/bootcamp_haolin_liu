**Subject:** Proposal: Data Analysis of Congestion Pricing's Impact on NYU Students

### 1. Problem
NYC's new congestion pricing policy creates a significant financial burden for our commuting students. We currently lack the data to understand the scale of this problem.

### 2. Proposal
I propose a data project to quantify this impact. By analyzing public transit data and a targeted student survey, we can measure the real-world financial and logistical effects on our students.

### 3. Outcome
This project will deliver a concise report with key metrics on increased costs and changes in commuting behavior. The findings will provide the necessary evidence to help your office design an effective student support program, such as a targeted commuter subsidy.
